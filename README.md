# Graph-Autoencoder-Drug-Recommender-GADR
 
GARD (Graph Autoencoder Recommender for Drugs) is a medication recommendation model based on graph autoencoders. This project utilizes dimensionality reduction and graph representation learning techniques to predict drug response. By incorporating clinical data and information on drug interactions, GARD aims to provide personalized recommendations for patients in healthcare settings.

Graph Autoencoder (GCN AE): Leverages advanced graph neural networks to create high-quality embeddings, enhancing the model's ability to capture complex relationships within clinical and drug interaction data.

Objectives
Reduce data dimensionality while retaining essential information for accurate prediction.
Provide personalized and precise drug recommendations.
Project Structure
Data Preprocessing - data collection, cleaning, and normalization.
Graph Construction - representation of drugs and their interactions.
Representation Learning - high-quality representation learning via the graph autoencoder.
Prediction and Recommendation - classification and recommendation based on embeddings.
