# Graph-Autoencoder-Drug-Recommender-GADR
 
GARD (Graph Autoencoder Recommender for Drugs) is a medication recommendation model based on graph autoencoders. This project utilizes dimensionality reduction and graph representation learning techniques to predict drug response. By incorporating clinical data and information on drug interactions, GARD aims to provide personalized recommendations for patients in healthcare settings.

### Features and Benefits
- **Graph Autoencoder (GCN AE)**: Leverages advanced graph neural networks to create high-quality embeddings, enhancing the model's ability to capture complex relationships within clinical and drug interaction data.
- **Accurate Drug Response Prediction**: Uses learned embeddings to provide precise predictions for drug response, enabling more effective patient care and minimizing the risk of adverse reactions.
- **Advanced Medication Recommendation System**: Employs convolutional neural networks and deep learning methods to generate personalized drug recommendations, tailored to individual patient profiles and health conditions.
