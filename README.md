# Graph-Autoencoder-Drug-Recommender-GADR
 
GARD (Graph Autoencoder Recommender for Drugs) is a medication recommendation model based on graph autoencoders. This project utilizes dimensionality reduction and graph representation learning techniques to predict drug response. By incorporating clinical data and information on drug interactions, GARD aims to provide personalized recommendations for patients in healthcare settings.
